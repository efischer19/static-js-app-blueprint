# AI Contributor Guide

This document defines the standard operating procedures for AI contributors to the `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` project. Follow these instructions precisely to ensure consistent, high-quality contributions that align with project principles.

## Role

You are an **expert software engineer** for this project. Your responsibilities include:

- Writing efficient, maintainable code that adheres to the principles in `meta/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md`
- Following established architectural decisions documented in ADRs
- Creating comprehensive tests for new functionality
- Maintaining the integrity of the `main` branch through careful, reviewable changes
- Documenting decisions and implementations clearly for future contributors

## Core Workflow

Follow this numbered standard operating procedure for all contributions:

1. **Review Project Principles**: Start by reading `meta/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md` to understand the core values that guide all development work.

2. **Examine Relevant ADRs**: Check `meta/adr/` for any Architecture Decision Records that relate to your task. Only follow ADRs with `Accepted` status. If your work conflicts with an accepted ADR, propose a new ADR to supersede it.

3. **Understand the Existing Codebase**: Explore the repository structure and read relevant code to understand current patterns, conventions, and architecture before making changes.

4. **Make Minimal, Surgical Changes**: Implement the smallest possible changes to achieve the goal. Prefer modifying existing code over creating new files when possible.

5. **Write Comprehensive Tests**: Create focused tests that validate your changes. Ensure they align with existing test patterns in the repository. If no test infrastructure exists, document why tests are not included.

6. **Validate Changes Iteratively**: Lint, build, and test your code frequently. Fix any issues immediately before proceeding. Use the project's established linting and formatting tools after every change to catch issues early.

7. **Commit with Clean History**: Make atomic commits with descriptive messages following conventional commit format. Each commit should represent a single logical change.

8. **Document Architectural Decisions**: If your work involves a significant decision not covered by existing ADRs, propose a new ADR with status `Proposed` for human review.

9. **Link Implementation to Decisions**: In your PR description, reference any relevant ADRs that provide context or constraints for your work.

10. **Leave Code Better**: Apply the Boy Scout Rule — leave any code you touch in a better state than you found it through minor refactoring and cleanup.

## Local Development & Quality Checks

Before submitting any pull request, ensure your changes pass the same quality checks that CI will run. Use the project's established tooling for formatting, linting, and testing.

**Important**: Always run these checks after making any code changes and before pushing commits. This prevents CI failures and reduces PR review cycles.

## Definition of a "Complete" Pull Request

A pull request is considered complete when it meets all of these criteria:

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] All acceptance criteria from the original issue are satisfied
- [ ] The implementation solves the stated problem without introducing new issues
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions are properly handled

### Code Quality

- [ ] Code follows the principles in `meta/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md`
- [ ] Changes are minimal and surgical — only necessary lines are modified
- [ ] Code is readable, well-named, and includes comments explaining complex logic
- [ ] No unnecessary complexity or premature optimization
- [ ] Code passes local formatting and linting checks

### Testing & Validation

- [ ] New functionality is covered by automated tests that pass
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] Manual verification confirms the feature works as expected
- [ ] Performance implications have been considered

### Documentation & Process

- [ ] Relevant ADRs are referenced in the PR description
- [ ] Any new architectural decisions are documented as proposed ADRs
- [ ] Commit messages are descriptive and follow conventional format
- [ ] The PR description clearly explains what changed and why

### Integration

- [ ] All CI/CD checks pass
- [ ] Code integrates cleanly with existing systems
- [ ] No conflicts with other ongoing work
- [ ] The `main` branch remains in a deployable state

Remember: The goal is not just working code, but maintainable, understandable code that future contributors (human and AI) can build upon confidently.
